Iteration 1

The following events have initially been encountered in a forcible-event loop of automaton Ep
* (Ep.on Ep.off)

Warning: (Ep.on Ep.off) is not forcible-unconnectable

The following events have initially been encountered in a forcible-event loop of automaton Ev
* (Ev.empti Ev.stopE)
* (Ev.fill Ev.stopF)

Es.LP_Es = 2, Es.LP_Es = 0
(Ev.empti Ev.stopE) is forcible-unconnectable
Es.LP_Es = 0, Es.LP_Es = 2
(Ev.fill Ev.stopF) is forcible-unconnectable

The following events have initially been encountered in a forcible-event loop of automaton RequirementStateEvtExcls
* (Ep.on)
* (Ep.off)

Warning: (Ep.on) is not forcible-unconnectable
Warning: (Ep.off) is not forcible-unconnectable
Iteration 2

The following events have initially been encountered in a forcible-event loop of automaton Ep
* (Ep.on Ep.off)

Ev.LP_Ev = 1 or Ev.LP_Ev = 2, Ev.LP_Ev = 0
Ev.LP_Ev = 1, Ev.LP_Ev = 0
Ev.LP_Ev = 2, Ev.LP_Ev = 0
(Ep.on Ep.off) is forcible-unconnectable
