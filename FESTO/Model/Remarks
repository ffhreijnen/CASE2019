In order to introduce location pointers, on every edge, a condition is added that refers to the current location as follows:

plant TwoStateActuator:
    controllable c_on, c_off;
    location On:
		initial;
        edge c_off goto Off;
    location Off:
        edge c_on  goto On;
end

Changed to:

plant TwoStateActuator:
    controllable c_on, c_off;
    location On:
		initial;
        edge c_off when On goto Off;
    location Off:
        edge c_on  when Off goto On;
end
